A) Easiest: build locally, push the build to GitHub Pages
1) Make sure your game is pygbag-ready

Your entrypoint must be main.py

The main loop must be async-aware (async def main(): ...; await asyncio.sleep(0))

(You already got guidance on this in the pygbag step.)

2) Build

From the folder that contains main.py:

pip install --upgrade pygbag
pygbag .


This creates a build/ output directory (commonly build/web/) containing an index.html and the runtime files.

3) Put the built site where GitHub Pages can serve it

Option A1 (recommended): copy the build output into a /docs folder in your repo:

rm -rf docs
mkdir -p docs
cp -r build/web/* docs/


Commit and push:

git add docs
git commit -m "Deploy web build"
git push

4) Turn on GitHub Pages

In your repo:

Settings → Pages

Under “Build and deployment”, choose Deploy from a branch

Select branch: main (or master)

Folder: /docs

Your game will be at:

https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

B) Cleaner: use a gh-pages branch (no build artifacts on main)

Same idea, but the website files live on a separate branch.

Build with pygbag (pygbag .)

Create/update gh-pages branch with the contents of build/web/

In Settings → Pages, set Source = deploy from branch, Branch = gh-pages, folder = /

This keeps main clean.

Common gotchas (and quick fixes)
1) Paths / base URL

GitHub Pages for project sites serves at /<repo>/…. If your build assumes it’s hosted at /, assets can 404.

Fixes:

Prefer relative paths in your game/assets loads

If pygbag provides a way to set base paths in its template/build options, use that (pygbag docs cover packaging + uploading).

2) Autoplay audio

Browsers block autoplay until user interaction; start music after a click/keypress.

3) Filenames with accents / weird escapes

For web builds it’s safest to rename files/modules to ASCII (you already have at least one risky filename in your zip).
